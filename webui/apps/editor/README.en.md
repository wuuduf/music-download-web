[简体中文](./README.md) | English

An open-source lyrics editor with per-syllable timing support, built with Vue.

Aiming to become the successor to [AMLL TTML Tool](https://github.com/amll-dev/amll-ttml-tool) and work seamlessly with the [AMLL](https://github.com/amll-dev/applemusic-like-lyrics) ecosystem.

**Currently in early development stage.** Track development progress on our [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/amll-dev/projects/1/)!

- **Stable version**: https://editor.amll.dev/
- **Development branch**: https://beta-editor.amll.dev/

## Deployment

This project is hosted on Cloudflare Pages — you can access it directly via the links above.

If you want to self-host the project, please note:

The spectrogram feature requires **Cross Origin Isolation (COI)** to be enabled. Your server must include the following response headers:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

This repository already includes a `_headers` file compatible with Cloudflare Pages that automatically applies these headers during deployment.

For other platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), please refer to their respective documentation to configure custom response headers.

**GitHub Pages does not support custom response headers**, so it cannot natively satisfy the COI requirement. This project includes an optional workaround: When the environment variable `VITE_COI_WORKAROUND` is set to a truthy value, a Service Worker (based on [gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker](https://github.com/gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker)) will be activated to emulate a cross-origin isolated environment.

Known limitations of this workaround:

- The page will perform an additional automatic reload on first visit
- The Service Worker only takes effect after this reload
- Compatibility checks are delayed by ~3 seconds to allow the Service Worker to fully register
